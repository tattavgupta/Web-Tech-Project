        <h2>ABOUT:</h2>
        <p>A cloud egg is a visually stunning and surprisingly simple dish where the egg white is whipped into stiff peaks, baked until golden and airy, then topped with an unbroken yolk and briefly baked again, creating a delightful textural contrast between the fluffy “cloud” and the creamy yolk. This whimsical take on a traditional egg offers a lighter, more visually appealing breakfast or brunch option.</p>

        <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
        <h3>Oven Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Crack each egg and separate the egg yolks from the whites. Place each egg yolk in individual small bowls or keep inside their shells. Place the egg whites and salt in a large bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Using a whisk or a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, starting on low speed and then slowly increasing to high speed, until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes in a stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon to transfer the stiff egg whites onto the prepared baking sheet and form two mounds. Then use the back of a spoon to make egg yolk-size indentations in the center of each one so they look like nests. Bake for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, then gently place each egg yolk in the indentation of each cooked egg white. Return the baking sheet to the oven, and cook for 4 more minutes. Allow it to cool for one minute. The yolk will continue to cook as it cools.</li>
            <li>Serve over avocado toast, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Microwave Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack each egg and separate the egg yolks from the whites. Place each egg yolk in individual small bowls or keep inside their shells. Place each egg white along with a pinch of salt in a microwave safe bowl or mug.</li>
            <li>Using a whisk or a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites in the bowl until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes with a hand mixer.</li>
            <li>Use the back of a spoon to make an egg yolk-size indentation in the center of the bowl so it looks like a nest. Microwave the egg whites for 25 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place the egg yolk carefully in the middle of the cooked egg whites, and return to the microwave for 30 more seconds, or more depending on desired level of doneness.</li>
            <li>Serve over avocado toast, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Hand Mixer</li>
            <li>Aluminum Sheet Pans</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Store any leftovers in an airtight container. They will last about 2 days in the fridge but best eaten right after they’re made.</li>
        </ul>
