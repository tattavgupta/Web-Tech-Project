            <li>8 ounce block feta cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Place the cherry tomatoes in an oven-safe baking dish. Pour the olive oil on top,
             and season with salt and pepper. Toss until well combined.</li>
            <li>Place the feta block in the middle of the baking dish surrounded by the cherry tomatoes,
             and flip a couple times to coat it with the olive oil and seasoning.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, until the cherry tomatoes burst, and the feta cheese melts.</li>
            <li>While the tomatoes and feta are baking, cook the pasta in a pot of salted water according to package
             instructions until al dente. Drain, reserving ½ cup of the cooking liquid in case you'd like to toss it in.</li>
            <li>Immediately add the garlic and basil leaves to the cooked tomatoes and feta and toss everything to combine.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked pasta to the baking dish and toss to combine. Garnish with more fresh basil and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>

                 However here are some common substitutes that would work well in this recipe.</dt>
            <dd>-Instead of cavatappi pasta, you can use any pasta or make it with gluten-free pasta</dd>
            <dd>-Instead of cherry tomatoes, you can use regular whole tomatoes or even canned diced tomatoes, but cherry tomatoes have the best flavor here.</dd>
